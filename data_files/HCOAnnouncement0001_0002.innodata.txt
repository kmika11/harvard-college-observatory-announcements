ANNOUNCEMENT CARD 2

ENSOR'S COMET. — Professor Frost writes that two
half-hour exposures with the 24-inch reflector of the
Yerkes Observatory by Van Biesbroeck on March 15.41
and 15.43 show no trace of Ensor’s comet. The plates
were centered on 21h 44m, +47° 40' and were moved so
as to follow the motion of the unseen object. Any
object as bright as the sixteenth magnitude would have
shown on the plates.

From orbital computations by Crommelin, Merton,
Merfield, and others, it was anticipated that the comet
would be a naked-eye object at this time. On January
11 Mr. Wood, at Johannesburg, found the magnitude
to be 7.5. The comet was then brightening steadily,
had a large head, with fairly well defined nucleus, and
a short 𐬶 of nearly one degree. No observations since
perihelion February 12, have been received here.

BLATHWAYT’S COMET. — Supplementing the
estimates of brightness given in H.A.C. 1, Van Biesbroeck
gives magnitude fifteen for the total brightness of
Blathwayt’s comet on March 9, visually estimated with
the 40-inch telescope. In the central condensation a
sixteenth magnitude star-like nucleus was then visible.

HARVARD ANNOUNCEMENT CARDS. — The cards will
give 𐬶 distribution to announcements
concerning the discovery and observations of comets, new
stars, asteroids of peculiar interest, and similar objects.
Subscribers to the telegraphic service will receive the
announcement cards without charge. Others may
obtain the series regularly for one dollar a year. The
material appearing on the cards will not be printed as
heretofore in the Bulletins of the Harvard Observatory.
